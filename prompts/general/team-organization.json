Time Zone Challenges:\n   - Document all team member time zones\n   - Define \"overlap hours\" for synchronous collaboration\n   - Establish async-first communication defaults\n   - Schedule recurring meetings during optimal overlap\n   - Rotate meeting times for fairness\n\n2. Synchronous Communication Guidelines:\n   - Meeting purposes and decision-making authority\n   - Recording and note-taking for async catchup\n   - Decision log for transparency\n   - RFCs (Request for Comments) for major decisions\n   - Status meetings vs working sessions\n\n3. Asynchronous Communication Norms:\n   - Documentation as source of truth\n   - Ticket/issue tracking for decisions\n   - Thread-based discussions (Slack, forums)\n   - Response time expectations by priority\n   - Context provision (background, links, rationale)\n\n4. Knowledge Management:\n   - Centralized wiki (Confluence, Notion, GitHub wiki)\n   - Decision records (ADRs - Architecture Decision Records)\n   - Runbooks and operational guides\n   - Regular documentation audits\n   - Video tutorials for complex topics\n   - Onboarding playbook\n\n5. Collaboration Patterns:\n   - Code review process (asynchronous)\n   - Pull request guidelines and SLA\n   - Pair programming (scheduled or ad-hoc)\n   - Office hours for questions\n   - \"Quick sync\" slots for urgent issues\n   - Shared calendars for availability\n\n6. Tools & Infrastructure:\n   - Communication: {{communication_tool}}\n   - Documentation: {{docs_tool}}\n   - Code collaboration: GitHub with defined workflows\n   - Video: async recording + live calls\n   - Project management: {{project_tool}}\n   - Time zone tools (timezone.io, Every.time.zone)\n\n7. Culture & Connection:\n   - Virtual social events (optional, respect time zones)\n   - Celebration of wins (async-friendly)\n   - One-on-ones (scheduled across time zones)\n   - Team building activities\n   - Psychological safety and trust building\n   - Avoiding \"always on\" culture\n\n8. Hiring & Onboarding:\n   - Clear time zone policy (flexible, specific, or required)\n   - Onboarding buddy system\n   - Async-friendly first week\n   - 30-60-90 day plans\n   - Manager check-ins (async + sync)\n\n9. Metrics & Health:\n   - Team satisfaction survey (async participation)\n   - Collaboration effectiveness metrics\n   - Meeting load tracking\n   - Documentation freshness\n   - Async response time SLA tracking\n\nTeam Size: {{team_size}}\nTime Zone Spread: {{tz_spread}}\nCurrent Tools: {{current_tools}}\n\nOutput: Communication Norms | Collaboration Playbook | Tools & Setup | Onboarding Guide | Team Health Dashboard",

Meetings: all-hands weekly (rotates 2 time slots for fairness), sprint planning async (48hr discussion window), retros in person when possible (quarterly off-sites). Decision-making: major decisions via RFC in Slack (#rfc channel), minimum 48hr response window, recorded in Linear tickets with rationale. Documentation: Notion for team processes (playbooks, onboarding, best practices), GitHub wiki for technical decisions (ADRs), READMEs in code repos. Async communication: Slack threads mandatory, PR reviews SLA 24hr for changes outside review, 48hr for cross-team changes. Code review: GitHub PRs reviewed async, pair programming scheduled explicitly. Collaboration: daily async standup via Linear (not Slack), weekly 30min all-hands sync, office hours 2x/week (EU-friendly, US-friendly). Tools setup: shared calendar with time zones, /remind for async updates, integration with Linear for notifications. Onboarding: buddy assigned, async docs-first introduction, manager 1:1s (async Slack, weekly video call). Expected: high engagement, low burnout, 90% async-capable workflow, team cohesion maintained across 16 hour TZ spread."

Root causes: Maven dependency downloading, slow unit tests (no parallelism), complex Docker setup, incomplete documentation. Quick wins: (1) Maven cache optimization (-4min); (2) Parallel test execution (-3min); (3) Improve README with screenshots (save 1hr onboarding); (4) Pre-built Docker images. Medium-term: local Kubernetes alternative (Skaffold/Tilt), Gradle instead of Maven (-30%), better IDE integration. Strategic: monorepo with gradle multi-project, internal developer platform. Metrics baseline: build 12min → target 2min (6 week effort), onboarding 48hr → 4hr (2 week effort), CI/CD 30min → 8min (4 week effort). ROI: 25 engineers × 0.5 hrs/day faster = 125 hours/week = 6500 hrs/year savings = $650K/year (at $100/hr eng cost). Investment: 200 hours = $20K one-time. Payback: 1 week.
